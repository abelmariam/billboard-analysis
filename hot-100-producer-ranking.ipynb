    "## Producer Ranking\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial inspiration behind this project was to (quantitatively) identify the most commercially successful producers and song-writers of today. In lieu of the fact having the raw sales and streaming data to work with in our dataset, our notion of commercial success will have to be defined through chart performance. One of the simplest definition of commercial success we can make is by only considering the volume of chart placements. That is, comparing the number of different songs that made it on the charts. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will define this problem more generically as such:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{producer_score}(\\text{producer}) := \\sum_{\\text{song} \\ \\in \\ \\text{producer.songs}} \\text{weight}(\\text{producer}, \\text{song}) \\cdot \\text{song_score(song)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of the score of a producer as being the weighted sum of the songs scores (of songs that they contributed to). The $\\text{song_score(song)}$ is a number that summarizes a song's commerical performance and the weights $\\text{weight}(\\text{producer}, \\text{song})$ represent the relative impact/importance of a producer's contribution to a particular song. We're initially interested in defining the score to be the number of chart songs that a producer contributed to. This can be accomplished by defining:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\text{song_score}(\\text{song}) & := 1 \\\\\n",
    "\\text{weight}(\\text{producer},\\text{song}) & := 1\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means all songs have the same score (irrespective of their actual chart performance) and all contributors are given the same score. We're going to have to adjust this if we want the $\\text{prod_score}$ to reflect a more accurate and comprehensive sense of commercial success. "

    "A lot of the names on the list don't come as a surprise (as they are the most sought after producers in the Hip-Hop and Pop music world). I was somewhat surprised to find that The Weeknd and CuBeatz were on this list being that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The Weeknd is primarily known for his work as a vocalist and performer, not as a producer. That being said, it is not uncommon for the performing artist/vocalist to get production credits for overseeing the development and musical direction of the song. For the purposes of our analysis, we want to focus more on the \"primary producers\", those most responsible for both define and execute the sonic direction of the song. Ironically, under this metric 'Doc McKinney', one of The Weeknd's longtime in-house producers, is actually ranked lower than The Weeknd.\n",

I had not heard of CuBeats prior to this but after looking at their credits through Genius, they had contributed to some of the most popular Hip-Hop songs in the past few years (mainly through their collaboration with other producers in the list, like Metro Boomin, Southside, and Murda Beatz). \n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these points address to the fact that many of the biggest Hip-Hop and Pop songs tend to have a number of different producers and song-writers that contribute to the song. We need to account for that by (ideally) weighting the song score by the relative significance of each proucer's contribution. Unfortunately, such information can't be obtained programatically through the Genius API, therefore we cannit assign weights to the producers non-uniformly. Thus, the most naieve solution to get around this is to just define the weight based on the number of contributors to the song:\n",
